[EXTRA] How to remove folder that accidentally tracked and pushed to GitHub Example:
If you have accidentally pushed your .idea folder with many files in it , here is the steps to remove it. -
Go to IntelliJ terminal in bottom menu -Type this command : git rm -r --cached .idea and hit enter -
if it is a file you may omit -r so it will be git rm --cached fileName-This will remove .idea folder
from local git repo and will not track it from this point on. -Make a commit and select all un-versioned files from
commit window and commit -Push it back to remote and observe it's been removed from remote repo as well

BranchingBranching in git is like opening upa new timeline for
new work to not affect what's already in the master branch.It's light-weight,
easy to create and when things do not work you can easily remove it,
when it works you can merge your changes into the master branch to get all your work reflected in master.?
